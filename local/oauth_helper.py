    """
    Handles the OAuth 2.0 flow to get valid user credentials.

    This function checks for cached credentials, refreshes them if necessary,
    and initiates a new OAuth flow if no valid credentials are found.

    This function is written from the perspective of an
    application seeking valid credentials in the most efficient way possible.
    It checks for credentials in the following order:
    1. Valid cached credentials.
    2. Expired credentials that can be refreshed.
    3. A pending authorization response from the user having been redirected back.
    4. Finally, initiating a new authorization request.
    To understand the beginning of the user-facing flow, start by looking at
    step #5 (`tool_context.request_credential`), which is where the user is
    prompted to log in and grant consent.

    Args:
        tool_context: The context of the tool run, provided by the ADK.
        credential_cache_key: The key to use for caching credentials in the session state.

    Returns:
        A valid `google.oauth2.credentials.Credentials` object if authentication
        is successful, or an `AuthConfig` object if the authentication flow
        has been initiated
        and is pending user action.
